# Code-Samples
This is a WIP repository to showcase snippets of my code. 

## Other Work
Much of my recent code has been for school projects, which unfortunately require private repositories to prevent plagariasm. Feel free to ask about them. The larger ones are listed below, most recent first.

## Personal Projects 
* MTGO Arbitrage Bot (java): A program that performed aribtrage on Magic the Gathering Cards. It involved scraping price data from various webservers as well as interacting with the trading client. Notably used Selenium Web Driver and Tess4J for web scraping and OCR respectively.
