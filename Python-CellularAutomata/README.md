Cellular Automaton is a discrete model studied in computer science. The most notable example being "Conway's Game of Life", which has been of interested to mathematicals and computation theory for decades. Practical applications range from procedural generation, error correcting codes, and modeling. For a graphical view of Conway's rules allow see https://playgameoflife.com/ or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE. 

This project is a general framework for cellular automaton supporting various rules and geometries.
Supported Geometries:
  Grid2D: A 2D grid, each tile has 8 neighbors
